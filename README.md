This project aims to predict the Elo ranking of titled chess players using Python. The data was obtained by scraping information from the official FIDE website using the Beautiful Soup library. The project involves data collection, analysis, and the creation of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model for predicting the Elo ranking.
